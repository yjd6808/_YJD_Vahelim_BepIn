Release Notes: https://discord.gg/wVNZf2DjwT

A handful of the creatures spawn by default, for the rest you can configure the spawns with spawnthat or use a configuration manager ingame. (Warning: Installing a new version will override your previous config) You can check out the prefablist in Discord to see what spawns by default.

Please do not reupload this dll. Make this a requirement.

Recommended configuration manager:
