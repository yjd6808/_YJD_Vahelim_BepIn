## About
Adds some new craftable dverger circlets in different colors with brighter light.

## Installation (manual)
Install *BepInEx* and *Jotunn* per the author's instructions.
Move the **CustomDverger folder** into your **Valheim\BepInEx\plugins** folder.

## Features
Two early game dvergers - crafted with flint and coal or resin. Same stats as regular dverger.
The rest are late-game dvergers, require silver, and provide armor. The light is brighter, covers more area and is tinted to the color of the stone.
