### Dependencies

This mod isn't standalone, to make it work properly you will need some other mods called dependencies so make sure that everything is installed as it should. To make it work properly you need 2 hard depencencies and the list is below.

* BepInEx Valheim
* Jotunn the Valheim Lib (not JotunnLib) called JVL
Take a not that JVL (above Lib) also got dependence which is MMHOOK

## Distribution

I don't mind much what you will do with this mod. You can redistribute it, you can edit it, you can place it in your modpacks without asking me. 
I am doing it in free time, for free using free software and legal copy of the game which i am not owner so atleast the last sentence should explain much why this should be shared and continued if someone is interested.

However, just don't recompile this mod and call it Yours. 
Also i didn't uploaded any mod source because it's mess for this moment and i think it will be shame to give it to anyone, so more informations about it soonTM but if someone is impatient just use some nice software to reproduce it.
