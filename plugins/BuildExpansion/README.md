# Build Expansion

Controller usage now should work fine, please remember I am a coder and not a console user, I do not have a controller to test, nor do I want to get one.

### 1.0.5 update ensures compatability with custom hammers and other PieceTables

Expands Hammer build table to desired height and width and adds a scrollbar.

Main purpose is to allow for mod developers to add pieces to build without worrying about exceeding limits.

## This mod does NOT include extra building pieces, it expands the build menu so that other mods can add them. 

## Known conflicts

PlantingPlus modifies certain aspects that make the grid alignment break. This mod is currently not compatible with BuildExpansion.

## Install

Place plugin in BepInEx\plugins directory

## Default mod values:

- Enabled : True
	- Whether the mod is enabled or not
- DisableScrollCategories : True
	- Disables the mouse scroll in Hammer build menu so that scrollbar can be used with mouse wheel.
- GridWidth : 10
	- New width of grid
- MaxGridHeight : 15
	- Sets a maximum value for grid height, if over 30 can impact performance.
