# Credit
This mod was created by [Aedenthorn](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/18901754?tab=user+files), I have just reuploaded it here to use with my modpack.

For updates check [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/174) as this probably won't be updated as regularly.

# Description
This mod pulls nearby items from the ground into containers.

The types of container this affects are ship, cart, wooden chest, personal chest, and reinforced chest.

You can customize the following:
- choose range at which items will be pulled into each type of chest
- choose which items cannot be pulled universally
- choose which items only can be pulled universally (overrides the former)
- choose which items cannot be pulled per chest
- choose which items only can be pulled per chest (overrides the former for each type)
- choose to only pull items that the container already contains
- choose a hot key to toggle the mod on and off

By default the ranges are set to 5m for each type.
