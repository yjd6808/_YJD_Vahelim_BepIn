 Better Archery + Equipment and Quick Slots Fix

! Please consider backing up your character before using this fix, just in case something goes wrong. !

When using Better Archery's quiver feature alongside Equipment and Quick Slots, items in the extra space provided will get lost when recovering your tombstone if your inventory is full. This mod attempts to prevent that from happening, and upon logging in also tries to recover lost items (sometimes they're still there, just hidden from the inventory panel). Items hidden this way should be dropped on the ground on login; if this doesn't happen they're likely unrecoverable.

Do dedicated servers need this?
Nope, just the client.
